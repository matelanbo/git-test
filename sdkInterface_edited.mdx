# zkShuffle SDK

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
zkShuffle SDK provides standard interfaces for interacting with shuffle manager contract.
The goal of this SDK is to simplify zk proofs generation and keys management.    

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
A game developer will be able to build a zk-game even without any experience in cryptography or zero knowledge proofs.
This allows them to focus on the game logic.

# Tutorial Step-by-Step

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
Let's suppose there is a simple game, 'zkhilo'. In this game, each of the two players has 1 card in hand for betting. Player holding the card with higher value wins the game. The full logic is as follows:

    ```ts
        zkHiLo Game Logic :
        1. deal card 0 to player 0
        2. deal card 1 to player 1
        3. bet
        4. player 0 open card 0
        5. player 1 open card 1
        6. win/lose
    ```
